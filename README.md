# Usage-of-delegates
I am going to create an application which executes one of three methods (Sum, Subtract, Multiply) based on a single provided parameter  First, I will write this example without delegates and then I will refactor that code by introducing delegates.
In first method(without delegates), I will get the correct response for any operation I send to the Execute method. But this code could be much better and easier to read without switch-case expression. If I am going to have more than ten operations (for example), this switch block would be very ugly to read and maintain as well. 
Therefor, letâ€™s change  code to make it readable, maintainable and more object-oriented. 
In second method (with delegates) I create a dictionary which will hold all the operations and all the references towards my methods (Func delegates) then I inject ExcutionManager class  into the OperationManager class and change the Execute method. At the first look, you can see how much better this code is.
